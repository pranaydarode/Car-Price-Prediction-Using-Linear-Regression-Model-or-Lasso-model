Car Price Prediction using Linear Regression and Lasso Model:
This repository contains code and resources for predicting car prices using both Linear Regression and Lasso Regression models. We trained our models on a dataset of car details, including features such as brand, horsepower, mileage, and other relevant attributes.

Dataset:
The dataset used for this project is available in the file car data.csv. It includes various features related to cars, such as brand, model, year, engine type, and price.

Model Training:
We implemented two regression models:

Linear Regression: Linear regression is a straightforward method for modeling the relationship between input features and output (price in our case). It assumes a linear relationship between the features and the target variable.
Lasso Regression: Lasso (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) is a regularization technique that helps prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the linear regression cost function. It encourages sparsity in the model coefficients.

Usage:
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Install the required Python libraries (e.g., pandas, scikit-learn).
Explore the Jupyter Notebook file Car Price Prediction.ipynb to understand the data, preprocess it, train the models, and evaluate their performance.

Results:
We evaluated the performance of both models and compared their predictions. Feel free to experiment with hyperparameters or feature engineering techniques to further enhance accuracy.

We thank the car industry and the open-source community for their valuable contributions.
